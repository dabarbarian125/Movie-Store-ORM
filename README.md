# Movie Database ORM Implementation using SQLAlchemy and SQLite
This is a simple example of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) database implementation using Python, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite for managing a dataset of movies. The project structure includes the necessary files such as the database, Python files, an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) of the database, and a test_main.py file for testing with pytest. 

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
SQLite

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the main.py script to perform queries on the database
- Run pytest command to test the application using the test_main.py file.
## Project Structure
- orm_utils.py - A script to initialize the data
- main.py - A script to perform queries on the database
- test_main.py - A test file for the project
- /backup - A directory that contains the SQLite database file in order to reset the database.
- /.lesson - A directory that contains the documents given to students.

## Background
This project was created for instructional purposes in a programming class at Alfred State. The dataset used in this project is fictional and was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atanaskanev/sqlite-sakila-sample-database.
